###### Disclaimer:
This is a UI demo of an unofficial TensorFlow (version 1.1.0) implementation of a publicly available research paper on Image Completion aka Inpainting i.e. completing images based on the surrounding pixel values.

The entire code has been written by me with the sole purpose of exploration. I don't have any intention of gaining any monetary benefits, whatsoever, from it.

The research paper can be found at the below location.

###### Note:
This service is for demo purpose only, the underlying model has been trained only on 12 images, hence results can't be compared to those in the Research Paper
